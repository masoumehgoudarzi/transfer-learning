# data-mining
In this data mining project, I develop a classification system to detect whether the patient has diabetes or not. As part of this project, I used and compared performance of the below machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes for patients: 

✔	Neural Networks   
✔	Decision Trees   
✔	Support Vector machine  
✔	K-Nearest neighbors
